ToDo list for sna-tools and net-fun kernel patch.
 - Many todos are found in the ChangeLog file.

Features that would be nice and are easy (but abit time consuming) to do:
- Configuration file conversion. This could be done 2 ways, the obvious
  is a tool that converts a given SNA implementations cfg file into a Linux-SNA
  configuration file. The not so obvious is a snaconfig option that uses a
  non-converted configuration file of another SNA server.

  The first option is generally useful, though the second is a cool feature
  though its usefulness could be debated.

Stuff that I will probably (never?) end up doing:
- Move guts of sna_nof.c to sna_ps_copr.c
- Code LUA interface for LU 0, 1, 2, 3
- Port Bus-Tech Channel Driver
- Code full SNA stack support for Channel
- Get Channel hardware
