ToDo list for sna-tools and net-fun kernel patch (never ending).
 - Maintained by Jay Schulist <jschlst@linux-sna.org>

- milestones and roadmap.
- xml configuration files for snaconfig and snatchd.
- configuration file conversion. A tool that converts a given SNA
  implementations cfg file into a Linux-SNA configuration file.
- make single sna interface via command `sna`, like iproute2.
- create libebcdic which works with international character sets.
- Talk to kernel stack with only ebcdic.
- Do full Xid.
- Handle APPN.
- Do basic LU6.2 so Aping test works.

xml:
 - read xml config file in.
 - display structures for debug
 - write xml config file out.

Goal:
1. APING loopback test.
2. Docs for APING loopback test.                2/9/2001
3. APING outside world test.
4. Docs for APING outside test.                 2/13/2001
5. Docs for setting up an LU6.2 Peer node.      2/15/2001

Short term todo(s):
- Loopback TPs should work swimmingly using full code paths.
- Build generic BIND processing engine.
- Build generic BIND build engine.
- Complete loopback (intranode) bind negotiation.
- Complete attach processing, using lfsid properly.

- Fix NodeID in XID header.
- Link station stop command sends out a DISC command to the partner and
  does a structured link teardown
- Complete internode bind.
- Expand handling of bind and unbind conditions.

Stuff that I will probably (never?) end up doing:
- Move guts of sna_nof.c to sna_ps_copr.c
- Code LUA interface for LU 0, 1, 2, 3
- Port Bus-Tech Channel Driver
- Code full SNA stack support for Channel
- Get Channel hardware
