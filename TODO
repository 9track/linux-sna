ToDo list for sna-tools and net-fun kernel patch.

/*
 * Critical Todo(s)
 */
1. CPI-C and APPC libraries.
2. kfree_s bad obj on node delete.
3. Finish XID changes, so one can build links again.

/*
 * Hardware Todo(s)
 */
1. TwinAx drivers.


/*
 * Non-Critical Todo(s)
 */
- snaconfig tool (always)
  - Configuration file support.
    The option exists but there is no backend support, a good
    configuration file design and parser is needed.
  - Case Sensativity
    It may be nice to allow case insensative options.
- API libraries. (CPI-C, APPC, LUA)
