Purchase:
0. get copy of System/370 Principles of Operation, GA22-7000.

Execute:
1. complete deallocate
2. send unbind and unbind processing.
3. set lu structure information proper.
4. show lu information nicely via /proc and snaconfig.

5. make xid, bind and attach process completely dynamic 
   (remove any remaining hardcodes).
6. add security to aftp and mode

7. xid error checking (2.9.6).
8. let user choose what xid type to send with link station.
9. store all fields of xid for adjacent ls and use them.
10. cleanup tdm proc output.
11. validate all incomming bind options.
12. inbound bind processing.
13. add intranode path control support back.
14. complete inbound attach processing in rm.
15. go through all code and compare with functional specs.
16. Add comments and use proper sense codes for everything.
17. cleanup fscking defines that are like 60+ characters long!
18. implement sna_ps_conv_process_fmh7_log_data_proc when not lazy.
19. validate xml file input.
20. make appc api values same as cpic
21. use cpic defined variable sizes
22. ensure that mode name is validated on allocate call
23. add parallel session option to mode.
24. finish testing data tx/rx paths.
25. Perform pacing better.
26. allow automatic start of dlc/link upon server start.

27. finish following cpic calls:
