ToDo list for sna-tools and net-fun kernel patch (never ending).
 - Maintained by Jay Schulist <jschlst@samba.org>

- Test all code to gurantee no lose of functs.
- Check into Changing LLC_UI code to a LLC netlink interface.
- Finish LLC code before do anything else (or else)!

Features that would be nice and are easy (but abit time consuming) to do:
- Configuration file conversion. This could be done 2 ways, the obvious
  is a tool that converts a given SNA implementations cfg file into a Linux-SNA
  configuration file. The not so obvious is a snaconfig option that uses a
  non-converted configuration file of another SNA server.

  The first option is generally useful, though the second is a cool feature
  though its usefulness could be debated.

Goal:
1. APING loopback test.
2. Docs for APING loopback test.                2/9/2001
3. APING outside world test.
4. Docs for APING outside test.                 2/13/2001
5. Docs for setting up an LU6.2 Peer node.      2/15/2001

Short term todo(s):
- Update Hardware and Software sections of linux-sna.org.
- Loopback TPs should work swimmingly using full code paths.
- Build generic BIND processing engine.
- Build generic BIND build engine.
- Complete loopback (intranode) bind negotiation.
- Complete attach processing, using lfsid properly.

- Fix NodeID in XID header.
- Link station stop command sends out a DISC command to the partner and
  does a structured link teardown
- Complete internode bind.
- Expand handling of bind and unbind conditions.
- snaconfig-file occasional flakiness.


Stuff that I will probably (never?) end up doing:
- Move guts of sna_nof.c to sna_ps_copr.c
- Code LUA interface for LU 0, 1, 2, 3
- Port Bus-Tech Channel Driver
- Code full SNA stack support for Channel
- Get Channel hardware
