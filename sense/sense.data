APPC SENSE DATA -- version 1.06 -- May 27, 1994
C0801
!0801xxxx  Resource Not Available
!
!Explanation:  The LU, PU, link station, or link specified in an
!RU is not available.  For example, this sense data can occur when
!a workstation is executing both of the following:
!
! - A 3270 network connection directly to the host
!
! - A link to an SNA gateway which is configured to support that
!  workstation.
!
!If the gateway sends an ACTPU to the workstation before the host,
!the workstation will reject the ACTPU from the host with this
!sense data. The 3270 emulator component logs this error as type
!0042, subtype 000002B2 in the OS/2 Communications Manager error
!log.  Unless this situation is corrected, the host will continue
!to send the ACTPU and each negative response will cause an error
!to be logged.
!
!Operator Response:  To correct this problem, do one of the
!following:
!
! - Change the configuration at the SNA gateway so that it no
!  longer supports the workstation.
!
! -   Change the configuration at the workstation so that its 3270
!  network connection is to the gateway.
!
!Bytes 2 and 3 following the sense code contain sense-code-
!specific information:
!
D0000
!0000
!
!No specific code applies.
!
! - On CINIT:  a destination LU rejected the CINIT because it
!  could not support the logical unit type (such as an LU type 2)
!  of the originating LU.
!
! - On INIT_SELF:  a destination LU rejected an INIT_SELF of the
!  SNASVCMG session.  The SNASVCMG mode session was being
!  activated with an INIT_SELF because the partner LU definition
!  in the OS/2 Communication Manager node definition file for a
!  dependent LU partner was set with
!  parallel_session_support(YES).  Changing to
!  parallel_session_support(NO) fixes this.
!
D0009
!0009
!
!The LU is not available because it is not ready to accept
!sessions. That LU is still in pending-delete state because it has
!active sessions with one or more partners.  However, no new
!sessions can be started.
!
D0012
!0012
!
!An APPN connection cannot be established because the local node
!has no available integers to represent a new transmission group
!(TG). This error is associated with XID processing.
!
!
C0805
!0805xxxx  Session Limit Exceeded
!
!Explanation:  The requested session cannot be activated because
!one of the network addressable units (NAUs) has reached its
!session limit (such as the LU-LU session limit or the LU-mode
!session limit).  This sense code applies to SNA ACTCDRM, INIT,
!BIND, and CINIT requests.
!
!Bytes 2 and 3 following the sense code contain sense-code-
!specific information:
!
D0000
!0000
!
!No specific code applies.
!
!For example, when VTAM is re-IPLed, all of its session limits are
!set to zero, pending an Initialize Change-Number-of-Sessions
!(CNOS) operation.  Connected nodes may see this sense data if
!they were previously connected to VTAM and have not issued the
!CNOS operation again after it re-IPLed.
!
D0001
!0001
!
!If accepted, the BIND request would prevent either the receiving
!LU or the sending LU from activating the number of contention
!winner sessions to the partner LU that were agreed on during a
!CNOS procedure.
!
!It is possible that two different LUs with the same name in the
!network attempted to set up sessions with the same third, target
!LU.  The target LU rejects the BIND request issued by the later,
!duplicate named LU with this sense data.  Each LU across every
!computer in an SNA network must have a unique, fully-qualified LU
!name.
!
!Operator Response:  Ensure that each LU has a unique, fully-
!qualified LU name in the same network.
!
D0002
!0002
!
!If the BIND request had been accepted, it would have caused the
!XRF-backup session limit to be exceeded.
!
D0003
!0003
!
!If the BIND request had been accepted, it would have caused the
!XRF-active session limit to be exceeded.  The session limit for
!XRF-active sessions is 1.  An XRF-active BIND is valid only if
!there are no XRF-active or XRF-backup sessions with the receiving
!secondary LU (SLU).
!
D0004
!0004
!
!For an independent LU, if the BIND request had been accepted, it
!would have caused the system-defined maximum number of sessions
!allowed for any LU to be exceeded for this LU.
!
D0005
!0005
!
!The intermediate session router is unable to create a session
!connector control block.  The pool of session connectors is
!saturated with active sessions and with pending active sessions
!for which the queue bit was set in the BIND request; the BIND
!should not be retried.

C0806
!0806xxxx  Resource Unknown
!
!Explanation:  The request contained a name or address not
!identifying a PU, LU, SSCP, link, or link station known to the
!receiver or the sender.
!
!In an interconnected network environment, this sense code may be
!set by an SSCP in whose subnetwork and domain the LU was expected
!to reside. It is not set by an SSCP that is only an intermediary
!on the session-setup path.  A gateway SSCP examines the Resource
!Identifier control vector in a session setup request (for
!example, CD-Initiate), to determine whether the LU is in the
!SSCP's subnetwork and domain.
!
!If bytes 2 and 3 appear to be out of range, they correspond to a
!CICS DFH message number.  See entry 'yyyy' below.  Otherwise,
!bytes 2 and 3 following the sense code contain sense-code-
!specific information:

!
!The resources identified in an SNA Address List (X'04')
!management services (MS) common subvector are unknown to the PU
!receiving the request.
!
!When this sense data flows in a -RSP(NMVT), the referenced X'04'
!subvector is the one that was present in the corresponding
!request NMVT. When this sense data flows in a Sense Data (X'7D')
!management services (MS) common subvector, the referenced X'04'
!subvector is present with the X'7D' subvector in the same major
!vector.

!
!The indicated resources in the accompanying Name List (X'06')
!subvector are unknown to the control point to which the request
!containing the subvector was routed.  Names in the hierarchy
!below the level of the first unknown resource are not examined by
!the control point.

!For a dynamic reconfiguration DELETE, MOVE, or REPLACE operation,
!the resource to be dynamically reconfigured could not be found.

!The LU address in bytes 8-9 of the Request Network Address
!Assignment (RNAA) request unit type X'4' is already in the free
!pool.

D0008
!0008
!
!For a dynamic reconfiguration DELETE, MOVE, or REPLACE operation,
!the network addressable unit (NAU) name in the Request Network
!Address Assignment (RNAA) request unit does not correspond to the
!resource identified by the element address in the RNAA.

!The SSCP(OLU) cannot identify the SSCP(DLU), and default SSCP
!rerouting is not enabled.

!
!The configuration identifier specified in a management services
!command is not recognized by the DLC manager at the receiving
!node.
!
D0011
!0011
!
!An unknown OLU name was specified in the request.  For example,
!this situation can occur when a local node is using an LU that is
!unknown to the subarea.  Ensure that all local LUs that set up
!sessions with a subarea host are configured at the host.
!
!With the OS/2 Communications Manager, this can occur when using
!CPI-C, but failing to set the APPCLLU environment variable to the
!correct local LU name.  The host will do CNOS to negotiate the
!session limits for the LU it is supposed to be using.  The APPC
!software in the local OS/2 computer then sends a BIND request
!with the wrong workstation LU name, and the host replies with
!this sense data.

!
!An unknown destination logical unit (DLU) name was specified in
!the request.

!
!The session-initiation request specified that the receiving SSCP
!is the SSCP having the DLU in its domain, but the DLU is unknown
!to the receiving SSCP.
!
!For VTAM, this sense data indicates that a link with a downstream
!node is defined incorrectly.  For example, this can occur when
!VTAM thinks it link to an adjacent node is an APPN-level link,
!but the adjacent node is treating the link as a LEN-level link.
!If the adjacent node had treated the link as APPN-level, it would
!have sent an APPN Locate to VTAM prior to sending its BIND
!request.  The result would have been that the RSCV used to route
!the BIND request would include an additional "Interchange TG"
!hop, which indicates to VTAM that the destination LU is actually
!located in the subarea network.
!
!If VTAM receives a BIND request over an APPN-level link and the
!RSCV ends on that VTAM (indicating that the DLU should be on that
!VTAM), then VTAM will reject the BIND request if the DLU is not
!owned locally. However, prior to rejecting the BIND request, VTAM
!will send a DSRLST into the subarea.  If the DLU is found in the
!subarea, this this sense data is set to inform the OLU that the
!DLU does not reside on this node.

!
!The TG (link) being activated is unknown.  The local or network
!APPN topology information may be incorrect.  This can occur
!because of one of the following conditions:
!
! - The local node is trying to use an "activatable on demand"
!  link, but could not activate the link.  This could happen for
!  any of the reasons a link activation can fail:  the link was
!  defined wrong, the remote node is not powered on, and so on.
!
! - An "activatable on demand" link is defined in the reverse
!  direction from where the local node is trying to go.  To
!  correct this, either make your local link "activatable on
!  demand", or change the configuration at the remote node so
!  that it is not "activatable on demand".
!
! - There is an inconsistency among the APPN topology databases of
!  the network nodes in the APPN network.  One way to spot
!  inconsistencies, using the OS/2 Communications Manager for
!  example, is to issue the DISPLAY_APPN verb, requesting
!  Topology Information.  See if there are any links shown as
!  active that are not actually active.  To correct this
!  condition in the local workstation, stop and re-start the OS/2
!  Communications Manager.  If this condition persists, there may
!  be an internal APPN software error somewhere in the network.

!specific information:
!
D0000
!0000
!
!No specific code applies.
!
!Note:  VTAM APPC will erroneously reject an inbound BIND request
!with this sense data if this is the first session for this LU (no
!CNOS yet) and the mode name is not SNASVCMG.  Some APPC resources
!will not react properly (for example, they will hang) when
!receiving this sense data. The expected sense data is

!The partner data link control (DLC) is not activated.  In the
!OS/2 Communications Manager a long timeout (for example, 30
!seconds) occurs before the verb returns.  Possible reasons this
!occurs are:

! - The target computer is not powered on.
!
! - The target data link control (DLC) is not activated.
!
! - The target MAC address is wrong.
!
! - The maximum number of links is exceeded.
!
! - All links configured in the local workstation are incoming.
!
! - Different service access points (SAPs) are defined.

!CP Transaction Error.  A CP Capabilities (X'12C1') generalized
!data stream (GDS) variable request was sent indicating
!conversation complete or without change direction (for example,
!CEB or ^CD) or CP Capabilities reply was sent indicating
!conversation not yet complete (for example, ^CEB).
!
!Generically, this sense data value is issued whenever the LU 6.2
!transaction to request and provide a CP Capabilities GDS variable
!does not take place as designed.  This is most easily detected by
!looking at the CEB and CD bits.  The SNA APPN Architecture
!Reference document is a bit more general; it tells implementers
!that this sense data is also to be used when any other
!transaction-related errors are discovered.  In reality, the
!REQ_CP_CAP_TP internal transaction program issues some
!RECEIVE_AND_WAIT verbs, and once everything is received, it
!checks for a primary return code of DEALLOCATE_NORMAL and a verb
!count of 2.  If either one is not true, it issues the 08090039
!sense data value.

!
!The management services (MS) major vector key is not supported by
!the receiver.  This may occur for one of these reasons:

!
!   -No network management application available (such as
!     NetView) to handle the NMVT.
!
!   -The network management application on the host does not
!     support the management services (MS) major vector key sent

!
!Access Security Information Invalid. The request specifies an
!Access Security Information field that is unacceptable to the
!receiver; for security reasons, no further detail on the error is
!provided.  This sense data is sent in FMH-7 or UNBIND.
!
!The partner LU rejected the user ID or password received on an
!incoming Attach, or there is a mismatch in the LU-LU security.
!
!For example:
!
! - The remote location is using OS/2 Communications Manager and
!  the TP definition specifies conversation_security(YES).  The
!  remote Attach Manager searched its list of valid user IDs and
!  passwords, but did not find the received combination.
!
! - When an application sends an Attach to the AS/400 with
!  security(NONE) (that is, with no user ID and password), the
!  AS/400 looks for a default user profile to assign the request
!  to.  If the default user profile is not set up, the AS/400
!  rejects the request.
!
! - For mismatches in LU-LU security, trace the line flows and
!  look in the BIND for the presence of structured data subfield
!  X'11'.
!
!  1.If subfield X'11' is present, then the workstation is
!     attempting to do LU-LU verification and the host is
!     rejecting it.  This is probably due to either 1) being
!     configured to not accept LU-LU verification from the
!     workstation, or 2) not being able to access the LU-LU
!     password.
!
!     Check the VTAM definitions to see if LU-LU verification is
!     allowed. To do this, check if the VTAM APPL statement has
!     SECACPT=NONE, which says "don't allow security fields in
!     incoming Attaches".  If the application (LU) really wants
!     RACF to check a user ID from a partner, this value should be
!     SECACPT=(ALREADYV or CONV or AVFV or PERSISTV).
!
!     If LU-LU verification is allowed, check the ACF2 definitions
!     for a resource named vtamnetid.vtamlu.cm2lu in class APPCLU.
!     Also, make sure that the class is active.  Or, turn off LU-
!     LU verification at the workstation.
!
!  2.If subfield X'11' is not present, then the workstation is
!     not attempting LU-LU verification and the host is requiring
!     it.  In this case, VTAM is probably configured to require LU-
!     LU verification and workstation is not configured for LU-LU
!     verification.
!
!     Once, again check the VTAM definition.
!
!Programmer Response:  The Allocate call issued by the local
!program has a wrong user ID or password parameter, or the remote
!configuration needs to be changed.  Look at the verb control
!block being used for this verb.  Verify that it specifies valid
!user ID and password parameters.
!
!Operator Response:  If the problem is with the remote
!configuration, assure that the user ID and password combination
!has been correctly defined there.  User IDs and passwords are two
!of the few APPC configuration fields that are case-sensitive.  Be
!sure that the combination of uppercase and lowercase letters
!matches those specified in the program.
!
!Also assure that if these are required (see the partner's TP
!definition), they will be accepted by the partner LU (see the
!remote location's definition of its partner LU).
!
!If the partner is using the OS/2 Communications Manager, look at
!its error log.  Find an error log of type 001A; its subtype
!indicates why this Attach was rejected.

!
!Explanation:  The current unit of work has been terminated; when

C0826
!08260000  FM Function Not Supported
!
!Explanation:  Function management request not supported.  A
!function requested in an FMD RU is not supported by the receiver.
!
!For example, given a connection from APPC/MVS to OS/2, VTAM or
!APPC/MVS is requesting the OS/2 Communications Manager to do
!something it doesn't support.  All the reasons for this should be
!reported via sense code 1003nnnn instead.  Get a trace of the
!OS/2 Communications Manager side to see the details of that sense
!data.
!
!
C0835
!0835xxxx  Invalid Parameter (with Pointer Only)

!Explanation:  The request contained a fixed- or variable-length
!field whose contents are invalid or not supported by the network
!addressable unit (NAU) that received the request.
!
Dxxxx
!xxxx
!
!Bytes 2 and 3 contain a two-byte binary count that indexes (0-
!origin) the first byte of the fixed- or variable-length field
!having invalid contents.
!
!The error usually indicates that the BIND request was rejected by
!APPC because of a syntax, state, or semantic error and points to
!an offset in the RU field of the invalid parameter.  If possible,
!look at the BIND request in a trace or message; the partner LU is
!wrong, or the spelling of the partner LU or mode name is wrong.
!
!For example, if a BIND request is rejected with a sense data of
!X'08350045', it implies that the field at offset X'45' is in
!error.  If the field at this offset is an LU name, is could
!indicate that duplicate LU names are present in the network.  If
!the field is a mode name, it could indicate a misspelled mode
!name was supplied on an Allocate call, or mode name definition
!was missing or misspelled at either the local or remote computer.
!
!With the OS/2 Communications Manager, you can make a simple fix
!by specifying inbound_plu(YES), allowing any incoming partner LU
!name.
!
D0018
!0018
!
!The partner LU rejected the value for "sync level" or "parallel
!session support".  For example, if you are connecting to IMS, it
!is likely that the problem is the parallel session support bit.
!To solve this, define a partner LU for use with the IMS adapter,
!and specify no parallel session support.
!
!This sense data is not used to report an invalid value in a
!management services (MS) major vector.  If the invalid value
!occurs in a formatted management services (MS) subvector, sense
!code X'086B' is used. If it occurs in an unformatted subvector,
!sense code X'0870' is used.

!0840xxxx  Procedure Invalid for Resource
!
!Explanation:  The received RU is not supported in the receiver
!for this type of resource.  For example:
!
! - SETCV specifies boundary function support for a type 1 node
!  but the capability is not supported by the receiving node.
!
! - The PU receiving an EXECTEST or TESTMODE is not the primary PU
!  for the target link.

!Bytes 2 and 3 following the sense code contain sense-code-

!
!Resource Not Found.  An APPN directory request (Delete or Find)
!could not be satisfied because the specified entry does not exist
!in the receiver's directory and the resource cannot be found in
!the network.
!
!The target LU may be owned by an APPN network node server that
!cannot be contacted, or it might not exist in the network at all.
!For example,
!
! - The network node server has lost its links to the other
!  network nodes in its APPN network.
!
! - A second NN has connected to an EN that already has an NN
!  server. If the second connection to the EN had been defined as
!  a LEN connection, or the EN's connection to the second NN had
!  been defined so that CP-CP session support had not been
!  requested, the CP LU would have been put in the APPN directory
!  when the link came up.  However, since it is a multi-tail EN,
!  the second NN did not put it in its directory; it will not
!  answer network broadcast searches for the EN positively.  You
!  want only the NN server to answer so that all the EN's links
!  are returned and considered for route calculation.  If your
!  node had any connectivity to the NN server, the Allocate call
!  would have worked from your NN, probably going across the
!  direct link.
!
!  Since ENs do not have to worry about answering network
!  broadcasts, it puts any contacted CP LU in its directory
!  database, so it could find the NN when it did an Allocate
!  call.  Of course, the NN then used the existing session to do
!  its Allocate call.

!Transaction Program Not Available--Retry Allowed.  The Attach

!
!The partner LU rejected the incoming Attach because it could not
!start the specified program immediately.
!
!If the partner LU is associated with the APPC Attach Manager in
!the OS/2 Communications Manager, some possible causes of this
!sense data are:
!
! - The Attach Manager associated with the partner LU is stopped.
!
! - The incoming_allocate_timeout defined in the TP definition at
!  the partner LU is zero or is too short.  This only applies if
!  the partner TP is configured as Queued.
!
! - The incoming_allocate_queue_depth configured in the TP
!  definition at the partner LU is too small.  This only applies
!  if the partner TP is configured as Queued.
!
! - At the remote location, the incoming Attach was queued,
!  waiting to be processed.  The intended program was remotely
!  started, but ended before it could process the queued incoming
!  Attach.
!
!Programmer Response:  Retry the allocation request.  However, to
!avoid congesting the network with attempted allocation requests,
!your local program should pause or wait for a keystroke before
!retrying the conversation.
!
!Operator Response:  Start the APPC Attach Manager, increase the
!incoming_allocate_timeout, increase the
!incoming_allocate_queue_depth in the configuration at the remote
!location, if appropriate.
!
!At the remote location, the remote program may have ended before
!issuing an Accept_Conversation (CMACCP) call (or equivalent) to
!receive the queued Attach.  If this action is unexpected, check
!the following conditions in the remote location:
!
! - The remote program might be failing to issue the
!  Accept_Conversation (CMACCP) calls correctly.
!
! - The remote program might be issuing Accept_Conversation
!  (CMACCP) calls with an incorrect tp_name.
!
! - The filespec field configured at the remote location could be
!  incorrect.

C084C
!084C0000  Transaction Program Not Available--No Retry
!
!Explanation:  The partner LU rejected the incoming Attach because
!it could not start the specified program.  Receiver cannot act on
!the request because resources required to honor the request are
!permanently unavailable.  The sender should not retry immediately
!because the situation is not transient.
!
!For LU 6.2, an Attach request (FMH-5) -- sent because of an
!Allocate by the local program -- specifies a transaction program
!that the receiver is unable to start.  The condition is not
!temporary. The sender should not retry immediately.  This sense
!data is sent only in FMH-7.
!
!Examples:
!
! - The intended program does not exist at the remote location.
!
! - If the remote location is using the OS/2 Communications
!  Manager, its TP definition may be configured with the wrong

! - The operating system or communications subsystem at the remote
!  location has exhausted its available resources and is unable
!  to start the remotely attachable program.
!
!  If the remote location is using the OS/2 Communications
!  Manager, the APPC Attach Manager at the remote location may
!  have failed to start the program because of an OS/2 error on
!  its internal DosExecPgm or DosStartSession function call.  Any
!  of the non-zero OS/2 return codes from these function calls
!  may cause this situation.  For example, the remote location is
!  running OS/2 Communications Manager and the remotely
!  attachable program is attach-manager-started.  If there is
!  insufficient memory for the Attach Manager to start the
!  program, the incoming Attach will be rejected with this sense

!0864xxxx  Function Terminated
!
!Explanation:  The conversation was terminated abnormally.  Other
!terminations may occur after repeated executions; the request
!sender is responsible to detect such a loop.
!
!Bytes 2 and 3 following the sense code contain sense-code-
!specific information.
!
D0000
!0000
!
!Premature Conversation Termination.  An active conversation was
!terminated abnormally.  This sense data is sent only in FMH-7 or
!UNBIND. The partner program may have issued a Deallocate
!type(ABEND) call, or the partner program may have terminated
!(normally or abnormally) without explicitly terminating the
!conversation.
!
!If the partner program is running on OS/2, this sense data would
!be seen locally if the partner program ended unexpectedly because
!of a protection fault.
!
!On the AS/400, this sense data can be caused by the absence of a
!valid routing entry in a subsystem.  If no specific subsystem
!device or remote location name has been entered, check to see if
!the subsystem QCMN is active.  If QCMN is active, be sure the
!routing entry for APPC programs (PGMEVOKE) is present in the
!subsystem.  If a subsystem other than QCMN is being used and a
!specific communications entry or remote location name entry is
!being used, be sure a routing entry with PGMEVOKE is specified in
!the same subsystem.  In both cases, the fix is to add a routing
!entry in a subsystem.
!
!When a routing entry is not available on the AS/400, this sense
!data is written to QSYSOPR.  There may be a job log produced, but
!it will not have any program information or CL statements
!printed.

!
!Excessive Elapsed Time--No Retry.  Excessive time has elapsed
!while waiting for a required action or event.  For example, a
!transaction program has failed to issue a conversation-related
!protocol boundary verb.  No retry of the conversation should be
!attempted.  This sense data is sent in UNBIND when there is no
!chain to respond to; otherwise, it is sent in FMH-7.

C087D
!087Dxxxx  Session Services Path Error
!
!Explanation:  A session services request cannot be rerouted along
!a path of SSCP-SSCP sessions.  This capability is required, for
!example, to set up a cross-network LU-LU session.
!
!Bytes 2 and 3 contain sense-code-specific information that

!
!No specific code applies.

D0001
!0001
!
!VTAM has searched all the SSCPs in the subarea network, but the
!fully-qualified LU name specified as the destination in the BIND
!request cannot be found.  The sense data means "routing
!exhausted", which implies that VTAM looked everywhere it could in
!the subarea and did not find the LU.  For example, this can occur
!if the wrong NETID or partner LU name is defined in the local
!node.  If the destination is more than one hop away, VTAM's
!adjsscp search will not find it.
!
!There are many possible causes, but the most likely are:
!
! - The LU name specified in the BIND request is incorrect (in
!  other words, the LU just doesn't exist in the subarea).
!
! - A VTAM adjacent SSCP table is wrong and the SSCP that actually
!  owns the LU was not searched because it did not appear in the
!  correct table.
!
! - A cross-domain resource management (CDRM) path is down and
!  that prevented the search from reaching the SSCP that actually
!  owns the LU.
!
! - This sense data is frequently seen when the host is
!  unavailable for a 3270 emulation session.
!
!An SSCP has attempted unsuccessfully to reroute a session
!services request to its destination via one or more adjacent
!SSCPs; this value is sent by a gateway SSCP when it has exhausted
!trial-and-error rerouting.
!
!This code is used when SSCP rerouting fails completely.  The
!remaining codes are used for failures to reroute to a particular
!SSCP.  For example, they are associated with specific SSCPs when
!information about a rerouting failure is displayed in the node
!that was trying to reroute.
!
!The sense data is generic, but VTAM typically generates a message
!with message number 894I or 895I that will contain additional
!sense data information about the real cause of the problem.

!The PU of an independent primary LU named in BFINIT does not have

!This condition is referred to as "non-adjacent CP-CP sessions".
!Many APPN implementations are dependent on the partner CP being

!For example, this can occur when VTAM receives a session request

!
!This sense data can also indicate that the partner LU recognized
!the TP name, but could not start the program.  One reason for
!this may be authorization problems.  Some implementations of APPC
!(such as VM) check that three things match up:  LU name, mode

!and password of each specific TP, and reject the Attach with this
!sense data if your program is not authorized to start the
!corresponding program on the remote computer.

!  must exactly match the tp_name specified on the Allocate call
!  in your local program.
!
!  The TP name field in the TP definition is one of the few APPC
!  configuration fields that is case-sensitive.  Be sure that the
!  combination of uppercase and lowercase letters matches those
!  specified in the program.
!
! - If the remote location is running the VM operating system,
!  this sense data will be received if the remote VM AVS is not
!  authorized via the *IDENT control statements in VM to send
!  information to the TP Program.  This sense data is saying that
!  there is no way to get to the TP Program on VM from the local
!  node.
!
!Programmer Response:  Check the validity of the TP name, and the
!designated partner LU and mode names.
!
!Operator Response:  On the remote computer, check the list of TP
!names to be recognized.  Ensure that they match the values
!supplied for the tp_name values on the Allocate call in the local
!computer.
!
!If this checks out (that is, the partner TP is correctly defined

!
!PIP Not Allowed.  The Attach request (FMH-5) -- sent because of
!an Allocate by the local program -- specifies program
!initialization parameter (PIP) data, but the receiver does not
!support PIP data for the specified transaction program.  This
!sense data is sent only in FMH-7.
!
!Explanation:  The partner LU rejected the Attach because the
!local transaction program specified program initialization
!parameters (PIP data) and either the partner LU does not support
!PIP data or the partner transaction program has no PIP variables
!defined.
!
!Programmer Response:  Do not use PIP data when communicating with
!this remote transaction program.  For example, APPC on the OS/2
!Communications Manager does not accept incoming PIP data.
!
D6032
!6032
!
!PIP Not Specified Correctly.  The Attach request (FMH-5) -- sent
!because of an Allocate by the local program -- specifies a
!transaction program name that requires program initialization
!parameter (PIP) data, and either the FMH-5 specifies PIP data is
!not present or the number of PIP subfields present does not agree
!with the number required for the program.  This sense data is
!sent only in FMH-7.
!
!Explanation:  The partner LU rejected the incoming Attach because
!the partner transaction program has one or more PIP variables
!defined and either the local transaction program has specified
!that no PIP variables are to be used, or the number of PIP
!variables defined by the local transaction program is different
!from the number specified by the remote transaction program.
!
!Programmer Response:  Specify that PIP data is to be used in the
!Allocate call, and make sure that the number of PIP variables
!agrees with the number required by the remote transaction
!program.
!
D6034
!6034
!
!Conversation Type Mismatch.  The Attach request (FMH-5) -- sent
!because of an Allocate by the local program -- specifies a
!conversation type that the receiver does not support for the
!specified transaction program.  This sense data is sent only in
!FMH-7.
!
!Explanation:  The partner LU rejected the incoming Attach because
!it or the partner transaction program does not support the
!specified conversation type.
!
!Programmer Response:  Change the transaction program so it uses
!the proper conversation type (basic or mapped).
!
!Operator Response:  Alternatively, have the TP definition partner
!changed to reflect the conversation type used by the program.
!
D6040
!6040
!
!Invalid Attach Parameter.  An Attach request (FMH-5) -- sent

!previously provided in the BIND negotiation.
!
D6041
!6041
!
!Synchronization Level Not Supported.  The Attach request (FMH-5)
!-- sent because of an Allocate by the local program -- specifies
!a synchronization level that the receiver does not support for
!the specified transaction program.  This sense data is sent only
!in FMH-7.
!
!Explanation:  The partner LU rejected the incoming Attach because
!the local transaction program specified an unacceptable
!sync_level parameter.  For example, the local transaction program
!issued an Allocate call with sync_level(CONFIRM), but at the
!remote computer it was configured as sync_level(NONE).
!
!Programmer Response:  Change the sync_level parameter on the
!Allocate call.
!
!Operator Response:  Alternatively, have the TP definition at the
!partner changed to reflect the sync_level used by the local
!transaction program.
!
D6042
!6042
!
!Reconnection Not Supported.  The Attach request (FMH-5) -- sent
!because of an Allocate by the local program -- specifies

D6043
!6043
!
!Unable to Reconnect Transaction Program--No Retry.  The Attach
!request (FMH-5) -- sent because of an Allocate by the local

D0001
!0001
!
!Too few bytes in XID3.
!
D0002
!0002
!
!The length specified in the Length field in the XID3 is different
!from the number of bytes received.  There is a mismatch between
!the number of bytes specified in the Length field of XID3 and the
!actual length of the received XID3.
!
!
C1016
!1016xxxx  XID Format 3 Parameter Error
!
!Explanation:  Data in the XID3 is not acceptable to the receiving
!component because the value in the received XID3 field, whose
!byte and bit offset is specified by the XID Negotiation Error
!(X'22') control vector (which also carries this sense code), is
!inconsistent with the corresponding field in the sent XID3.
!
!Bytes 2 and 3 following the sense code contain sense-code-
!specific information:
!
D0001
!0001
!
!The field in the received XID3 that specifies the Maximum number
!of I-frames that the sender can receive before acknowledgment is
!set to zero.
!
D0002
!0002
!
!The adjacent node has been inconsistent in its request for ACTPU.
!In a nonactivation XID3 exchange, it has changed the value of the
!ACTPU Suppression indicator sent in the previous XID3 exchange.
!
D0003
!0003
!
!The field in the received XID3 that specifies the maximum basic
!transmission unit (BTU) length that the sender can receive is set
!to less than 99 bytes, which is the minimum required.
!
D0004
!0004
!
!The received XID was not XID format 3 when XID format 3 was
!expected.
!
D0005
!0005
!
!The adjacent node does not support BIND segment generation but
!does support receipt of BIND segments.  Any Type 2.1 node
!supporting receipt of BIND segments must also support generation
!of BIND segments.
!
D0006
!0006
!
!The adjacent node is an APPN end node, does not support BIND
!segment receipt, and has a maximum basic transmission unit (BTU)
!size of less than 265, the minimum required here.
!
!Here's an anecdote: "I ran and formatted an OS/2 Communications
!Manager trace at the OS/2 network node and discovered that the NN
!was receiving a Sense data X'10160006'.  I looked it up, and
!found out that the Macintosh SNA*ps 5250 was using a maximum BTU
!size of less than 265 (the minimum) and that the XID of the
!partner should be the NN instead of the AS/400. I increased the
!size and changed the XID and everything works fine now".

!The adjacent node is an APPN network node, does not provide
!control point (CP) services, and supports CP-CP sessions on this
!TG, a combination not allowed.
!
D000A
!000A
!
!During a nonactivation XID exchange, the adjacent node has
!changed the TG number that was negotiated during the link
!activation exchange.
!
D000B
!000B
!
!The adjacent node is the TG number negotiation winner and
!designates a TG number that the receiving node cannot allocate to
!this connection. When parallel TGs are supported between the two
!nodes, 0 is always such a number.
!
D000C
!000C
!
!The adjacent node is an APPN network node that does not support
!BIND segment generation, and this node's maximum basic
!transmission unit (BTU) size is less than 521.
!
!Operator response:  Increase the node BTU size to at least 521.
!
D000D
!000D
!
!The adjacent node is does not support the SDLC command response
!profile.
!
!Operator response:  The only defined value for this profile is
!X'0'.  Make sure that the platform correctly sets that value
!(bits 4-7 of byte 12 of the XID).
!
D000E
!000E
!
!Two different Product Set ID (X'10') control vectors have been
!received from the adjacent node.
!
!Operator response:  There can be only one provided on the XID.
!Verify that the platform specifies only one Product Set ID on the
!XID.
!
D000F
!000F
!
!The link station roles specified in the sent and received
!negotiation-proceeding XID3s are not compatible.  To activate a
!connection, one node must contain a primary link station; the
!other, a secondary link station.
!
D0010
!0010
!
!The support of combined asynchronous balanced mode (ABM) link
!stations indicated in the sent and received negotiation
!proceeding XID3s is not in agreement.
!
D0011
!0011
!
!This can occur for one of the following reasons:
!
! - The adjacent node is attempting to activate parallel TGs, when
!  parallel TGs are not supported between these two nodes.
!
! - The link cannot be activated because the adjacent node does
!  not support parallel TGs, and another link is active (or
!  pending-active) to that node.
!
D0012

!
!The DLC Type field in the sent and received XID3s are not the
!same.
!
D0014
!0014
!
!The adjacent NRM link station sent an XID3, indicating that it
!contains a negotiable link station, after having indicated that
!it contained a link station with a nonnegotiable role.

!The adjacent node supports adaptive BIND pacing as a sender, but
!not as a receiver.
!
D0016

!
!The local node is attempting to activate a TG with a predefined
!number, but the adjacent node has attempted to use a non-zero
!number that is different from the one the local node used to
!represent the TG.
!
D0017
!0017
!
!After two negotiation proceeding XID exchanges, two negotiable
!link stations still have equal values in the Node Identification
!fields of their XID3s.

!X'40' RH Usage Error
!
!This category indicates that the value of a field or combination

!No link is available to an APPN network node server.  No NNCP
!server was found when a local program issued an Allocate call to
!get a session with its associated partner LU.
!
!This sense data indicates that a session activation failed
!because APPC could not find any link to connect it to the partner
!node.  If your node is serviced by an APPN network node, this
!sense data means that your node could not contact that network
!node (probably because the link is down or defined incorrectly).
!
!For example, when using the OS/2 Communications Manager in your
!local node, check to see that it is serviced by an APPN network
!node.  If not, it means that you have not provided a valid
!DEFINE_PARTNER_LU_LOCATION together with a DEFINE_LOGICAL_LINK
!verb which specifies the link to use.  Assure that the
!DEFINE_LOGICAL_LINK verb contains a valid fq_adjacent_cp_name
!parameter and the link is either active, or is defined as
!activate_at_startup(NO) (which brings it up right away, as
!opposed to when the OS/2 Communications Manager is started).
!
!Summary:  either
!
! - Your node does not have a link to an APPN network node; thus
!  it has no place to send the Locate RU.
!
! - Your node does not have a link to the target node, where the
!  searched-for LU is located.
!
!Examples of how this can happen:
!
! - The target MAC address for the APPN network node is wrong.
!
! - The data link control (DLC) was deactivated on either
!  computer.
!
! - APPC is not fully started yet on your local computer, and the
!  links have not yet been activated.
!
! - The partner LU name is just wrong.  The partner LU name is
!  spelled wrong or does not exist.  If the application is using
!  CPI-C, check the CPI-C side information table to assure that
!  the correct partner LU name is specified.
!
!If you had this session working before, it is likely that your
!link to your partner or network node has gone down.  Thus you
!could have failures now even though you have not changed your
!configuration.  If the network node goes down and comes back up,
!your link is not automatically re-established.  (Look for the
!NNLINK package for a tool to keep that link up).
!
!To check this out, go to the Logical Link Services, and see if
!your link is displayed as inactive.  If it is, re-activate it
!using the same panel.  (If it's not, there's some other problem -
!- probably a configuration problem.)
