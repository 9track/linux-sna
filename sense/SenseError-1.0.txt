The half-session receiving the request did not perform the function because it is not capable of doing so. The requesting half-session requested a function that the receiver does not support and the receiver did not specify that it was capable of supporting the function at session activation; consequently, there is an apparent mismatch of half-session capabilities. Note: This is to cover a system error. For example, if the PU receiving a SETCV(Vector Key=X'15') is not a gateway PU, that is, the PU did not indicate in the ACTPU response that it is a gateway PU, the PU reports to the SSCP that sent the SETCV that there is an apparent mismatch of half-session capabilities.

The half-session receiving the request did not perform the function, though it is capable of doing so.

For example, if the SSCP sending a SETCV(Vector Key=X'15') is not known to the receiving PU as a gateway SSCP, that is, the SSCP did not indicate in ACTPU that it is a gateway SSCP, the PU reports a mismatch of capabilities.

The resources identified in an SNA Address List (X'04') MS common subvector are unknown to the PU receiving the request. Note: When this sense data flows in a -RSP(NMVT), the referenced X'04' subvector is the one that was present in the corresponding request NMVT. When this sense data flows in a Sense Data (X'7D') MS common subvector, the referenced X'04' subvector is present with the X'7D' subvector in the same major vector.

Resource Unknown
For example, the request contained a name or address not identifying a PU, LU, SSCP, link, or link station known to the receiver or the sender. Note: In an interconnected network environment, this sense code may be set by an SSCP in whose subnetwork and domain the LU was expected to reside; it is not set by an SSCP that is only an intermediary on the session-setup path. A gateway SSCP examines the Resource Identifier control vector in a session setup request (for example, CDINIT), to determine whether the LU is in the SSCP's subnetwork and domain.

On an ABM TG on which secondary-initiated nonactivation XID exchanges are supported, the adjacent link station has initiated a nonactivation exchange by sending a nonactivation XID3 in which the ABM Nonactivation XID Exchange Initiator indicator specifies that the sending node is not initiating a nonactivation exchange. On such TGs, the initiator of a nonactivation exchange always explicitly indicates that it is initiating a nonactivation exchange.

An NC-ER-TEST was to be sent as a result of receiving a ROUTE-TEST request. The ROUTE-TEST was sent in one subnetwork, and the NC-ER-TEST was to be sent in another. The SSCP sending the ROUTE-TEST did not have a required alias address within the subnetwork where the NC-ER-TEST was to be sent. (Before sending ROUTE-TEST, the SSCP sends RNAA, or the installation predefines the alias address, so that an origin SSCP address is available within the subnetwork of the route being tested. This address is then specified in the NC-ER-TEST RU.)

An error was detected by the DLC manager of the receiving node during the execution of a management services request. If n=X'A', the link connection status has not changed from the state previous to the execution; if n=X'B', the link connection status was modified from the state existing previous to the execution. The error is specified as follows: m=X'1' for volatile storage error, m=X'2' for nonvolatile storage (e.g., file access error), m=X'3' for link connection component (e.g., modem) interface error, and m=X'4' for unspecified software error conditions.

An intermediate SSCP has lost connectivity with an SSCP in the session setup path for an LU-LU session. This sense data is used when the SSCP previously lost connectivity with one or more participating gateway nodes so that it cannot learn that the LU-LU session is ended by receiving a NOTIFY RU from a gateway node.

Permission Rejected--SSCP Will Be Notified
The receiver has denied an implicit or explicit request of the sender; when sent in response to BIND, it implies that the secondary LU will notify the SSCP (via NOTIFY vector key X'0C') when a BIND can be accepted, and the SSCP of the SLU supports the notification. (See the X'080A' sense code for a contrasting response.)

For LU 6.2, Premature Conversation Termination
The conversation is terminated abnormally; for example, the transaction program may have issued a DEALLOCATE_ABEND verb, or the program may have terminated (normally or abnormally) without explicitly terminating the conversation. For LU 6.2 half-duplex conversations, this sense data is sent only in FMH-7 or UNBIND. For LU 6.2 full-duplex conversations, this sense data is sent also in the negative response that precedes an FMH-7 when there is a chain to respond to. The sense data in the negative response results in advance notice to the transaction program (in the form of an error return code) that an ERP message is forthcoming. For this error, the ERP message will contain the same sense data value used in the negative response. For non-LU 6.2, no additional information is specified.

An SSCP in the session setup path for an LU-LU session has lost connectivity with a gateway node traversed by the session, and has no other way to learn that the session has ended. An intermediate SSCP sends this sense data to one adjacent SSCP when it had previously lost connectivity with the other adjacent SSCP on the same session setup path. An endpoint SSCP sends this sense data to its adjacent SSCP when it had previously lost connectivity to a dependent LU or the boundary function of an independent LU.

An SSCP has attempted unsuccessfully to reroute a session services request to its destination via one or more adjacent SSCPs; this value is sent by a gateway SSCP when it has exhausted trial-and-error rerouting. Note: This code is used when SSCP rerouting fails completely. The remaining codes are used for failures to reroute to a particular SSCP. For example, they are associated with specific SSCPs when information about a rerouting failure is displayed in the node that was trying to reroute.

The end node no longer requires network node services from the receiver; e.g., the end node has found a more preferred network node server.

RTP Error
This category indicates that an error was detected by RTP. Two types of RTP errors can occur: Semantic: message errors that cannot be detected without knowledge of the message context, i.e., the history of prior, relevant messages as well as nodal definition. Errors of this type are errors of meaning. An example of a semantic error is the detection of a duplicate transport connection identifier. Syntactic: message errors that can be detected without knowledge of the message context. These errors can be detected by knowing the rules used to build a message. Errors of this type are errors of form. An example of a syntactic error is the absence of a required control vector.
