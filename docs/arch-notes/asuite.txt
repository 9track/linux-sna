These are the tools that make up the Linux-SNA APPC application suite (Asuite).
To compile these progams on Linux, you must first install the Linux-SNA 
software.  After that simply unpack the source archive, cd into the resulting
directory, and type make.  The tools should compile without any error or 
warnings.  Please report any problems to either the mailing list, or myself.
I can be reached as mmadore@turbolinux.com.  Bug reports and patches are both
welcome.

NOTE: While the tools will compile, the Linux-SNA stack is not quite ready to 
actually run the tools.  If you would like to help develop, debug or test the
tools, you will need to have access an SNA Unix environment.  The tools are 
known to compile and run on IBM's Communications Server for UnixWare 7.1.1.

It should also be possible to build and use the code on other Unix platforms
that have an SNA stack.  This may require tweaking the Makefile.  In 
particular, you will probably have to change the name of the SNA library you
link to.
