README: etc-sna compile and installation instructions.

Author:

There is nothing to compile just install.

In the etc-sna directory type 'make', this will install the Linux-SNA
environment on your system.

The configuration files /etc/sna.cfg and /etc/snatchd.conf need to be
configured for your system.
