Release 1.00pre14:
+ Fixed registration error for CPI-C static kernel stub.

+ Fixed a problem with LAR which responded to any query frame, even for networks
  that we are not on.
+ Fixed a display problem when LAR returns from a query.
+ Fixed LAR query to only return results with exact match, 
  see /proc/net/sna/lan_address_discovery to view the entire LAR list.
+ Put a stop to snatchd and it's oopsen. This required fixing a good number of
  file descriptor and inode problems in the attach static stub.
+ Fixed the file descriptor handling for CPI-C sockets.
+ Fixed parse bug of snaconfig for -a and -d options, no more core dump.
+ Fixed CPI-C string handling problems and miss match in cpic.h (user/kernel).
+ Fixed string use/display problems with CPIC symbolic destination name.
+ Fixed display error of MAC address of adj-node of link station define.
+ Verified integrity of all common snaconfig-stdin commands.
+ Verified integrity of snaconfig configuration file usage.
+ Verified snaconfig input debugging interface as acurate.
+ Fixed problem with defination of mode partner lu.

Release 1.00pre12:
+ Fixed bug with stdin input which stoped one from defining most parameters.

+ Fixed problem with responding to remote query frames.

Release 1.00pre11:
+ Added the configure options for CPI-C and APPC back.
+ Fixed a problem with setting the debugging level when using stdin-snaconfig.
+ Fixed a bug in sna_tdm_define_node_chars which was freeing a struct it did
  not own.
+ Fixed af_ipx.c not being updated to use the new llc code.
+ Fixed a Makefile proble not compiling in the 802.3 code in devlink.

Release 1.00pre10:
+ Completed the snaconfig make-over. Finished all the stdin() cmd 
  stop/start/delete commands. Also basic testing of all commands.

Release 1.00pre9:
+ Incomming I data packets are now properly routed and distributed into the
  sna protocol machine (Session and Nonsession traffic take different code
  paths).
+ Bind function flow is correct.
+ Fixed the displaying of Netids by proc which was breaking snaconfig.
+ Cleaned up printks so that they are now on only when debugging is on.
+ Added generic facility to handle output of debug messages.
+ Cleaned up alot of the compile time warnings
+ Massive snaconfig cleanup including: single/generic backend command
  block processor, uniform front-end api to allow easy addition of new
  command file/input formats.
+ Added debug function to display all the information in a snaconfig input
  control block.
+ Cleaned up snaconfig display so all information is now either shown as
  short or long, depending on the option choosen, short by default.
+ Removed some redundant display structures.
+ Added display of COS information through snaconfig.
+ Mode, CPIC side, and COS information is only shown with the -a option.
+ Fixed nodeid input problem in snaconfig.

Release 1.00pre8:
+ Activate route now can detect if the connection is already active and if
  the connection is a loopback.
+ Activate route now returns a pcid after a successful XID negotiation.
+ Added /proc/net/sna/path_controls to display pc instances.
+ Added /proc/net/sna/asm_active_address_space
+ Added /proc/net/sna/asm_active_lfsids
+ Made ASM do things a bit more proper with all the new information available,
  massive sna_asm.c cleanup.
+ Fixed assign_lfsid to use proper address space associated with a pc_id.

Release 1.00pre7:
+ Fixed NULL XID handling.. it is not a PN XID
+ Fixed LLC event handling for SABME needs to change XID state to ACTIVE.
+ Fixed LLC DISC command handling.
+ Removed XID direction indicators from the Xid processor and moved them
  in to the proper connect_in/_out function.
+ Now answer RR P/F properly.
+ Reliable XID communications with most any LLC SNA partner in both directions.

Release 1.00pre6:
+ Added Stop Link Station command... it can be rather helpful at times.
+ Fixed a silly problem of the Destination MAC address not being passed
  in binary form.
+ Created generic XID information structure for both Tx and Rx XIDs.
+ Built generic XID processing engine for both Tx and Rx XIDs.
+ Overhauled and completed Tx/Rx XID build engine.
+ XID flow and handling is now reasonably correct and extensive.
+ XID control vectors are so dynamic it is silly.
+ Fixed some very annoying white-space padding problems with FQCP records.
+ Outgoing XID/Link activation should be easily done by all.

+ Added Topology DataBase Manager.
+ Added Route Selection Services.
+ One can define COS levels from snaconfig now.
+ Added lots more Link station and mode options.
+ Fixed non-recognition of debug-level parameter in conf file.
+ Now when one starts a link the XID and BIND are retried on failure if
  specified until X number of times.
+ /proc interface to view all COS levels
+ /proc interface to view all TDM records.
